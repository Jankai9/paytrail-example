# Server Setup Instructions

## Starting the Server

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node maksupalvelu.js
```

This command assumes you have Node.js installed and [`maksupalvelu.js`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjkaip%2FProjektit%2Fnode%2Fpaytrail2%2Fmaksupalvelu.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\jkaip\Projektit\node\paytrail2\maksupalvelu.js") is your server file.

## Generating a Self-Signed SSL Certificate

Follow these steps to generate a self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS connections:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Create a directory for your SSL files, if it doesn't already exist:

```bash
mkdir -p ssl
```

4. Generate the self-signed SSL certificate and key with the following command:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ssl/key.pem -out ssl/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=YourState/L=YourCity/O=YourOrganization/CN=yourdomain.com"
```

- This command generates a new RSA key and a certificate valid for 365 days.
- The `-nodes` option specifies not to encrypt the private key.
- Adjust the `-subj` option values according to your needs or use them as placeholders for testing.

5. In your [`maksupalvelu.js`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fjkaip%2FProjektit%2Fnode%2Fpaytrail2%2Fmaksupalvelu.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\jkaip\Projektit\node\paytrail2\maksupalvelu.js"), make sure to reference the generated files correctly:

```javascript
const httpsOptions = {
  key: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'ssl/key.pem')),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'ssl/cert.pem'))
};
```

Now, your server is configured to use the self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS connections. Note that browsers will warn about the certificate being untrusted because it is self-signed. This setup is suitable for development and testing environments.
